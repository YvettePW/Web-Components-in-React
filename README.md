# Web-Components-in-React
## Exercise on Web Components in React
<img src="reactcomponents.png" width='300'/>
This exercise demonstrates web components native to the browser and React components at the same time. Attributes or properties that we normally use within React components are passed one at a time.
<br></br>
To run this on your machine, download the files, start an http-server on your local machine, and navigate to localhost:8080.
<br></br>
Additional functionality that would be helpful to a user for future iterations would be to add a navigation bar to the top and to be able to do a search for specific titles, authors, etc.
